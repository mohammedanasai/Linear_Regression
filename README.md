This repository demonstrates Linear Regression, a fundamental statistical and machine learning technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

It includes:

Linear Regression Basics: Fit a linear model, interpret coefficients, and make predictions.

Regularization Techniques: Implement Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net regression to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.

Assumptions & Diagnostics: Covers key assumptions including linearity, independence of errors, homoscedasticity (constant variance of residuals), normality of residuals, and absence of multicollinearity. Includes checks using residual analysis, correlation (e.g., Pearson), and other diagnostic measures.

Key Features:

Python implementation using scikit-learn

Dataset exploration and visualization

Example workflows for model evaluation, tuning, and regularization
